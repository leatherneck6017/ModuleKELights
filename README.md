### Idiot Lights

Monitor the resource of a single part or shipwide with Idiot Lights.  No, I didn't create hundreds of parts to monitor every resource. This is ONE part that you can configure to monitor any resource.

### Non-Idiot Lights

Blinking lights have the ability in the hangar to set the on/off duration from .1 seconds to 10 seconds.

Rotating and tilting lights have the ability in the hangar to adjust the rotation and tilt speed.
